// FAQ items
export const FAQ_ITEMS = [
  {
    question: "How do I know if my Rudraksha is authentic?",
    answer: "Authentic Rudraksha beads have natural ridges (mukhis), sink in water rather than float, and come with our certificate of authenticity. We also provide microscopic images of each bead's unique characteristics."
  },
  {
    question: "Which Mukhi (face) Rudraksha should I choose?",
    answer: "Different Mukhis correspond to different deities and benefits. 5 Mukhi (Lord Shiva) is universally beneficial, while others have specific purposes. We recommend starting with 5 Mukhi and exploring others based on your spiritual journey."
  },
  {
    question: "How should I care for my Rudraksha?",
    answer: "Keep your Rudraksha dry when not wearing it, clean periodically with a soft cloth, and re-oil it with sandalwood or coconut oil every few months. Store in a clean, sacred space away from negative energies."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you ship internationally?",
    answer: "Yes, we ship to over 90 countries worldwide with expedited and standard shipping options. Each package includes insurance and tracking information."
  },
  {
    question: "What is your return policy?",
